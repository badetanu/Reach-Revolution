First, consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about their skincare needs and are looking for products that address their specific concerns, such as acne, wrinkles, or pigmentation. Personalization technologies are allowing brands to match products to an individual's unique needs, whether through AI-driven quizzes, skin analysis tools, or even genetic testing that tailors product recommendations based on a personâ€™s DNA. Additionally, personalization is being extended to packaging, allowing consumers to design their own product packaging and aesthetics, further enhancing their engagement with the brand.</p> <p>Another critical factor driving market growth is the increasing role of social media and influencers in shaping beauty trends.
