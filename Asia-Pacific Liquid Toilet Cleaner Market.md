This segment benefits from the increasing adoption of liquid toilet cleaners in residential homes due to growing concerns about sanitation and cleanliness. Rising disposable incomes, urbanization, and an improved standard of living have fueled the demand for these products in homes, especially in metropolitan areas where the focus on hygiene and cleanliness is paramount. Household liquid toilet cleaners are commonly used for regular cleaning tasks, eliminating dirt, grime, stains, and bacteria from toilet surfaces, and ensuring better hygiene standards. Many consumers are opting for more convenient, easy-to-use products that also provide long-lasting freshness, which has led to the development of specialized toilet cleaning formulations tailored to meet these needs.The demand in this subsegment is driven by increased awareness about the importance of cleanliness and the rising health-consciousness among consumers in households. Households with children, elderly members, and individuals with respiratory conditions are particularly inclined toward purchasing liquid toilet cleaners that are non-toxic and free from harsh chemicals. There is also a growing shift toward natural, environmentally friendly products, further driving the growth of this subsegment. As a result, manufacturers are introducing liquid toilet cleaners with plant-based ingredients and sustainable packaging to cater to this rising demand for eco-friendly options.
